# Computer Architecture Final Team Project

This is a project called Chrono Timer 9000 which is an application that simulates the events of various track and field events by
using sensors and pads and then records the information so that it can be displayed real time to the user, in the form of an
external file, and via the web through a web application (ZeroCoolWebService).

If the website is still hosted, it can be found on the link below which explains the application in GREAT detail.
